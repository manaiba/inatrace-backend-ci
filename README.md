# INATrace

INATrace is a digital open-source solution designed to enhance the economic conditions of smallholder farmers by improving the traceability of global supply chains. Funded by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) and implemented by GIZ, INATrace provides an efficient internal management system for cooperatives, digitally stores supply chain data, and supports compliance with regulations like the EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR).

Project is composed of 4 parts, coordinated from the [INATrace project hub](https://github.com/agstack/inatrace) (project-wide documentation and governance):

* [Frontend application](https://github.com/agstack/inatrace-frontend)
* [Mobile app](https://github.com/agstack/inatrace-mobile)
* [Java backend](https://github.com/agstack/inatrace-backend)
* [Coffee network](https://github.com/agstack/inatrace-coffee-network)

## Installing / Getting started

### Requirements
* Java `17` or higher
* Maven `3.8.5`
* MySQL `8.4.11`

### Optional
* Docker
* Mailhog

### How to run
1. Clone the repository

2. Import as maven project to your preferred IDE

3. Prepare environment
   1. [Create database](#create-database)
   2. (*OPTIONAL*) [Email testing](#email-testing)
   3. [Spring configuration](#spring-configuration)

4. Run `INATraceBackendApplication.java`

#### Create database

Spin up a container:

```
docker run --name inatrace-mysql -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root -e MYSQL_DATABASE=inatrace -e MYSQL_USER=inatrace -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=inatrace -p 3306:3306 -d mysql:8.4.11
```

Tables will be created and prefilled with starter data on application startup.

#### Email testing

MailHog is an email testing tool for developers. It runs a SMTP server on port `1025` which intercepts messages and displays them in a GUI.

Spin up a container:

```
docker run --name inatrace-mailhog -p 1025:1025 -p 8025:8025 -d mailhog/mailhog:v1.0.1
```

The GUI is available at [`localhost:8025`](http://localhost:8025).

#### Spring configuration

Spring uses `application.properties` file stored in `src/main/resources` for configuration. A template is provided, see instructions below.

- Make a copy of `application.properties.template` and save it as `application.properties`
- Fill the missing values

*NOTE*: The values defined below are applicable for a local development environment. For other environments, change the values accordingly.

The values of these properties are provided by Beyco. If integration with Byeco is not needed, the values of these properties should be empty.

## APIs

### OpenAPI

Resources are annotated with Swagger annotations. After the application is started, the Swagger service definition JSON is served at `http://localhost:8080/v3/api-docs`, and Swagger UI is served at [http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html).

Both live at the root of the server rather than under `/api`. Every endpoint the application itself defines is published under `/api` — `PrefixedApiRequestHandler` adds that prefix to the mappings in the `com.abelium` packages — but springdoc's own endpoints are not touched by it. `http://localhost:8080/api/swagger-ui.html` does not exist.

#### Postman

Using Postman, you can create a collection from the Swagger definition.

- Select `Import > Link`
- Enter [http://localhost:8080/v3/api-docs](http://localhost:8080/v3/api-docs)
- Click `Continue`
- Review configuration
- Click `Import`
- Change host variable
  - Click on newly created collection
  - Click `Variables`
  - Edit row `baseUrl` to contain `localhost:8080` as current value

All requests are populated with sample requests, but the content is random. Fill in data to accommodate your test case.

### Authentication

Clients authenticate against `POST /api/user/login` endpoint and receive a JWT token in the `Set-Cookie` response header. The token is valid for 1 hour. See section [Common requests](#common-requests) below for a sample login request.

| Response header | Value                                                                                            |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Set-Cookie      | inatrace-accessToken=`JWT`; Path=/; Max-Age=3600; Expires=Thu, 24 Mar 2022 13:33:34 GMT; HttpOnly |

When accessing secured endpoints, the token has to be provided in the `Cookie` request header.

| Request header | Value                      |
|----------------|----------------------------|
| Cookie         | inatrace-accessToken=`JWT` |

It always contains attribute [`status`](https://github.com/agstack/inatrace-backend/blob/main/src/main/java/com/abelium/inatrace/api/ApiStatus.java).
If response is successful, then `status` is equal to 'OK' and appropriate response can be found under `data` attribute.
If response is unsuccessful (see the above link for other statuses), then `errorMessage` attribute is returned.

Example of successful and unsuccessful response
```
{
  "status": "OK",
  "data": {
    "id": 4,
    "email": "example@example.com",
    "name": "Example",

      1
    ]
  }
}
```

```
{
  "status": "AUTH_ERROR",
  "errorMessage": "Invalid credentials"
}
```

### Currency service

Currency service manages exchange rate data retrieval and currency conversion. 

#### Exchange rate retrieval

The service uses [exchangeratesapi.io](http://exchangeratesapi.io/) API for fetching currency conversion rates. It runs daily at 00:01 system time. The API is limited to 250 requests per day.

#### Currency conversion

The service exposes methods `convert` and `convertAtDate` to convert between any two supported currencies. `convert` uses the latest localy stored rate. `convertAtDate` uses the rate at the specified date. If the exchange rate for the specified date is not stored locally it fetches it from the API.

## Database

### Version
MySQL `8.4.11`

### Connection

If you are using a database management tool, use the following parameters to create a connection:

- Hostname: `localhost`
- Port: `3306`
- Database: `inatrace`
- Username: `root`
- Password: `root`
- Use SSL: `true`
- Driver settings:
  - `allowPublicKeyRetrieval`: `true`

### Entities

A complete list of entities is available [here](https://github.com/agstack/inatrace-backend/tree/main/src/main/java/com/abelium/inatrace/db).

Below is the entity graph for an initialized INATrace database. The full-sized vector image can be found [here](docs/images/inatrace_db.svg).

![INATrace DB entity graph](docs/images/inatrace_db.svg)

#### Users

There are two types of users:

- System users (User)
- Company users (CompanyUser)

*System users* are used for logging in. Based on their role, they have different permissions inside the system. Available roles are:

- User - can access resources that are owned by the company where the user is part of.
- System admin - can administer system-wide resources and settings.
- Regional admin - can administer resources that are owned by the company/ies where the user is part of. 

*Company users* are essentially role mappings for system users within a company. Based on their role, they have different permissions in the context of the company. A system user with role *User* can have the role *Admin* in a company. Available company roles are:

- User
- Admin
- Manager
- Accountant

#### Translations

Some items have names, descriptions and other data in multiple languages. To enable extensible adding of translations, these entities have a one-to-many mapping to corresponding Translation entities (e.g. Company and CompanyTranslation).

- CompanyTranslation
- FacilityTranslation
- ProcessingActionTranslation
- ProcessingEvidenceFieldTranslation
- ProcessingEvidenceTypeTranslation
- ProductTypeTranslation
- SemiProductTranslation

### Schema and data updates

Flyway is used to update the database when adding, changing or removing rows or columns. Here's how to configure a migration:

- Create a new class in `com.abelium.inatrace.db.migrations` package and `implement JpaMigration`
- Name should be in format `V<yyyy>_<MM>_<dd>_<hh>_<mm>__<Descriptive_Operation_Name>`
- `@Override` the `migrate` method
- Implement the necessary additions, edits and deletions

#### Running the migrations

The migrations run automatically at application startup. Once completed a record is created in table `schema_version`. A migration does not run again if a record already exists.

## Building

To build an executable `jar` run the following command in the project root directory:

```
mvn clean install
```

### Docker image

Official images are published to `ghcr.io/agstack/inatrace-backend` by CI; see
[RELEASE.md](RELEASE.md) for the tags and the release process.

To build an image locally:

```
docker build --build-arg REVISION=dev -t inatrace-backend .
```

The image contains no configuration. Mount an `application.properties` based on
`src/main/resources/application.properties.template` at `/app/config/application.properties`:

```
docker run -p 8080:8080 -v ./application.properties:/app/config/application.properties:ro inatrace-backend
```
